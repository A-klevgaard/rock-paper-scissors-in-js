ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS-IN-JS

PROGRAMMER: AUSTIN KLEVGAARD

This is a small rock-paper-scissors game created in javascript, capable of running in the browser console. 
It has been updated to have the game displayed on a webpage, however it is still very rudimentary.

If I have time in the future and want to come back to it, I may update it so that the user just has to click on 
text that say "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors" to make their move so they they don't have to rely on 
a console prompt blocking out the webpage.
